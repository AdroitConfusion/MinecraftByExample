The xml files can be used in IntelliJ IDEA to rename classes from earlier versions of Forge to later versions.  Doesn't do method or field renames.
To use:
# Drop the XML file into your Intellij migrations directory.
#   This is usually <USER FOLDER>/.IdeaIC2018.3/config/migrations/ or similar.
#   If that file doesn't exist, use Refactor->Migration to create a new dummy migration with a distinctive name and then
#   search your user folder for it.
# Restart IntelliJ, then do Ctrl+Shift+A (to select all source code) -> Migrate -> Select the XML -> Run -> Do refactor
